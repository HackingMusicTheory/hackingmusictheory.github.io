One of the biggest hurdles in switching over to a Standards Based Grading system is dealing with the amount of data generated.  One solution for dealing with this is to use the spreadsheet App by Google, which combines the power of a spreadsheet with the scripts and file management possibilities that also come with Google Drive.  I've set up a Github site that walks you through the process of setting up Standards Based Grading system within Google Drive.  [Here you'll find all of the scripts](https://github.com/pduker/SBG-Scripts-for-GDocs) that will manage your spreadsheets in addition to templates that you can copy and use to set up your courses quickly.  

Additionally, here are two quick tutorials to walk you through the process of first setting up the spreadsheet:
