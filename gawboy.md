In a [flipped](http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/eli7081.pdf) or
inverted classroom, students acquire a basic understanding of a topic on
their own and come to class to engage the topic more deeply in the
presence of their instructor and peers. Flipped pedagogy has caught the
attention of [mainstream
media](http://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/25/us/25iht-educside25.html) because
many instructors use digital technology to disseminate information,
particularly pre-recorded [video
microlectures](http://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI7090.pdf).
Video lectures allow students the opportunity learn the material at
their own pace because they may pause the video to take notes, review as
needed, and fast-forward through topics they already understand. This
heightened user control is attractive to many students. As one of my
students remarked, “I never realized before that I struggled in theory
because I couldn’t take notes as fast as the teacher was talking.”
Archiving videos online enables students to preview the week’s topic
over the weekend when they may have more time and re-watch certain
videos before a high-stakes exam or project.

There are many music theory video lectures now available on sites such
as YouTube and Vimeo. Some feature an instructor lecturing as he or she
would in front of a live class, and some are
[screencasts](https://net.educause.edu/ir/library/pdf/ELI7012.pdf).
While both types of video can be effective at delivering course content,
screencasting offers several distinct advantages over a recorded
classroom lecture. Screencasts allow the smooth integration of spoken
word, written text, musical scores, diagrams, animations, and audio,
with the added benefit of higher-quality visuals and often a snappier
pace. Free screencast programs, such as
[Screenr](http://www.screenr.com/) and
[Screencast-O-Matic](http://www.screencast-o-matic.com/), provide a
user-friendly interface and basic functionality, while commercial
software such as [Camtasia](http://www.techsmith.com/camtasia.html) and
[Adobe Captivate](http://www.adobe.com/products/captivate.html) enable a
user to add annotations, import audio, and edit out slips of the tongue
and other verbal “noise” that can potentially distract students.

Since January 2012, I’ve created over fifty video screencasts covering
nearly every topic in our first-year curriculum at Ohio State
University: fundamentals, species counterpoint, diatonic harmonic
idioms, harmonic sequences, periods and phrases, applied chords, and
modulation. Here are some lessons I’ve learned:

1. Compress the topic. Aim for clarity and brevity rather than
comprehensiveness. Think of the videos as a bare-bones introduction that
will be fleshed out and further contextualized in class. I still have to
remind myself to not overteach online, but it helps to ask myself what
is the least amount of information students would need to know to get
started on an activity.

2. Keep up the pace. Online time is different than in-person time. The
declamation style I developed for delivering information in the
classroom (speaking slowly, pausing to let the note-takers catch up,
emphasizing the main points though repetition) sounds lugubrious on the
video. It also sounds that way in class, but there it serves a function
that is unnecessary online. Students control the pause button, so the
actual pace of the videos can be faster than most in-person lectures.

3. Keep the videos short. It is an oft-repeated canard among educators
that college students’ attention tends to drift after about 10-15
minutes of lecture, although it’s [probably more
likely](http://teachingcenter.wustl.edu/Journal/Reviews/Pages/student-attention.aspx) that
students’ ability to sustain attention varies among individuals and
class periods. Still, shorter is better, and many screencasting guides
propose 5-10 minutes as the ideal length for an online lecture. More
constrained topics could be covered in even less time, while more
complex topics could be broken into digestible chunks.

4. Make the video interactive. Many of my video lessons fall into two
parts: a short lecture covering the basics of a given topic followed by
a demonstration of selected writing or analysis exercises. During the
[demonstration
section](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b-6bT_xA48&feature=youtu.be#t=4m50s),
I’ll walk students through a series of steps, asking them to pause the
video and fill in something on their own before providing them with my
answer. This emphasizes the procedural sequence and helps keep students
engaged. When they see my answer, it gives them immediate feedback as to
whether or not they’re on the right track.

5. Provide an alternative. While the vast majority of my students
appreciate the advantages online videos offer, there are always some
students who feel they simply cannot learn “from a computer.” I usually
assign short handouts or textbook readings that everyone can use as a
supplement or quick review.

## Theory I Sample Module

A [Video
lecture](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9b-6bT_xA48&feature=youtu.be) on
writing suspensions in fourth species counterpoint.

A [Handout on Fourth
Species](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10835951/How%20to%20Write%20Fourth%20Species%20Counterpoint%20%28suspensions%29.pdf) summarizing
the main points and providing some extra topics to explore in class.

A [Practice
worksheet](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10835951/Practice%205a.pdf) that
students partially fill out while they watch the video and complete on
their own before class. I usually spend the first 5-10 minutes of class
asking students to self-assess or peer assess selected problems not
completed on the video. I might give out an answer key for analysis
sections or ask students to develop their own rubric to help reveal
partwriting errors. I ask students to circle their errors, correct them
if they have time, and write me a note indicating what is still
conceptually unclear or self-identify persistent errors they think they
need to work on. During this time period, I walk around and check in
with everyone, answering individual questions as needed.

The remainder of class time is dedicated to active engagement with the
material through mini-composition projects, performance, and listening
activities. At Ohio State, the music theory classes are divided into 5-7
sections taught by faculty members or graduate teaching associates. One
of the main advantages I’ve found in working with the flipped classroom
model is that the videos help unify our approach to course content
across sections while allowing individual instructors time to develop
and experiment with their own creative teaching strategies. 

[Here is a link](https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0B6ue381O2ggEb1ljX2RmcGk4NEk&usp=sharing) to a folder
containing several plans for in-class activities designed by myself
and my graduate teaching associates.

The online video lectures and practice worksheets are only a small step
stone toward a larger course goal such as the [counterpoint composition
project](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/10835951/Counterpoint%20Project%20Guidelines.pdf),
where students are asked to compose a mixed-species counterpoint to a
given cantus firmus and perform it as a duet in class.
