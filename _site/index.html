<h2 id='hacking_the_music_theory_classroom_pedagogical_tools_that_increase_efficiency_and_effectiveness'>Hacking the Music Theory Classroom&#58; Pedagogical Tools that Increase Efficiency and Effectiveness</h2>

<p><em>A special session co-sponsored by the IT/Networking Committee and the Music Theory Pedagogy Interest Group</em><br /><em>Society for Music Theory (SMT) Annual Meeting<br />Charlotte, North Carolina, Sunday, November 3, 2013</em></p>

<p>This special session will focus on three &#8220;hacks&#8221; to the traditional model of music theory instruction: standards-based grading (SBG), &#8220;flipping&#8221; the classroom, and just-in-time teaching (JiTT). In SBG, students receive grades in reference to clearly defined learning objectives rather than individual assignments. In the flipped classroom, class time is devoted to active engagement rather than lecture. JiTT assesses students’ understanding before class so that the instructor can adjust the lesson plan according to the students’ needs. These tools and the technologies that support them have the potential to help strengthen curricula, increase the impact that an instructor can have on undergraduate theory students, and reduce the amount of time an instructor must devote to achieve that impact.</p>

<h2 id='materials_for_smt_2013'>Materials for SMT 2013</h2>

<p>The latter half of this session will be &#8220;flipped,&#8221; meaning that discussion will center around questions and resources posted here. Attendees are encouraged to read and watch these resources, and submit comments and questions on the website, in advance of the session. Of course, attendees will be able to follow presentations and participate in discussions without engaging this material beforehand.</p>

<p>The primary questions that we will address in the flipped portion of the session are:</p>

<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>SBG: What do we assess in our students&#8217; work? What is a meaningful breakdown of learning objectives? (example: what assessment categories might one use for a voice-leading assignment?)</strong></p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>JiTT: If you were to implement exploratory quizzes in class, how would you weigh those quizzes in the students&#8217; overall assessment?</strong></p>
</li>

<li>
<p><strong>Flipped class: Once informational content delivery has been moved outside of class time, what does one do during class? And what are the implications (structural and legal) for that online content?</strong></p>
</li>
</ul>

<p>The principal resources we have created to support the discussion of these questions are:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong><a href='shaffer.html'>Online resources in an inverted course</a>, Kris Shaffer</strong></li>

<li>Duker resource forthcoming</li>

<li>Gawboy resource forthcoming</li>

<li>Hughes resource forthcoming</li>
</ul>

<p>To discuss these issues or resources with the authors or the SMT community in advance of the session, or to ask questions you would like addressed at the session, please comment on the individual resources. If discussing these resources on Twitter, please use the hashtag <a href='https://twitter.com/search?q=%23mtped&amp;src=typd&amp;f=realtime'><em>#mtped</em></a> (for &#8220;music theory pedagogy&#8221;). Three of the panelists will be following the Twitter discussion before, during, and after the session—<a href='http://twitter.com/philduker'>Philip Duker</a>, and <a href='http://twitter.com/brynmdhughes'>Bryn Hughes</a>, and <a href='http://twitter.com/krisshaffer'>Kris Shaffer</a>—and all four will monitor the comment threads.</p>

<p>During the special session, please visit the <a href='discuss.html'>discussion page</a> to join in on a &#8220;backchannel&#8221; discussion (or simply follow along), and to ask questions for discussion during the &#8220;flipped&#8221; portion of the session.</p>
