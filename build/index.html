<p><em>A special session co-sponsored by the IT/Networking Committee and the Music Theory Pedagogy Interest Group.</em></p>

<p>On this website you will find information and materials pertaining to a special session taking place at the annual meeting of the Society for Music Theory (SMT), in Charlotte, North Carolina, on Sunday November 3, 2013. This special session will focus on three &#8220;hacks&#8221; to the traditional model of music theory instruction: standards-based grading (SBG), &#8220;flipping&#8221; the classroom, and just-in-time teaching (JiTT). In SBG, students receive grades in reference to clearly defined learning objectives rather than individual assignments. In the flipped classroom, class time is devoted to active engagement rather than lecture. JiTT assesses students’ understanding before class so that the instructor can adjust the lesson plan according to the students’ needs. These tools and the technologies that support them have the potential to help strengthen curricula, increase the impact that an instructor can have on undergraduate theory students, and reduce the amount of time an instructor must devote to achieve that impact.</p>

<p>This special session will be divided into three parts. In Part I (30 minutes) the presenters will define and explain standards-based grading, the &#8220;flipped&#8221; class, and just-in-time teaching. In Part II (60 minutes), each panelist will describe the way they employ these techniques in their respective institutions. In Part III (90 minutes), the panelists will lead a deeper discussion of the pros and cons of these methods.</p>

<p>Part III of this session will be &#8220;flipped&#8221;, meaning that discussion will reference resources posted here. Attendees are encouraged to read and watch these resources, and submit comments and questions on the website, in advance of the session. Of course, attendees will be able to follow presentations and participate in discussions without engaging this material beforehand.</p>
